                <h2>What Are the Mudskippers?</h2>
                <img src="./mudskipper.jpg" height="250"/>
                <p>Mudskippers are any of the 23 extant species of <strong>amphibious fish</strong> from the subfamily Oxudercinae of the goby family Oxudercidae.
                    They are known for their unusual body shapes, preferences for semiaquatic habitats, limited terrestrial locomotion and jumping,
                    and the ability to survive prolonged periods of time both in and out of water.

                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p><em>Mudskippers</em> typically live in burrows in intertidal habitats, and exhibit unique adaptations to this environment that are not found in most intertidal fishes, which typically survive the retreat of the tide by hiding under wet seaweed or in tide pools.[6] These burrows are most often characterised by their smooth and vaulted ceilings. The way the males dig these burrows has been found to be directly linked to their ability to survive submerged in almost anoxic water. It has also been found to play a crucial role in the development of the eggs within the burrow. Mudskippers are quite active when out of water, feeding and interacting with one another, for example, 
                    to defend their territories and court potential partners.</p>

                <p>Mudskippers prefer a soft sandy substrate where they can forage and keep moist, sand has a low impaction risk compared to gravel and is better on their skin. The land and water area can be separated by large pebbles, a stone tile slab, a piece of acrylic or driftwood. The land area should consist of a mixture of 3/4 washed river sand and 1/4 plantation soil to provide a good growing substrate for plants and ample algae growth that mudskippers like to graze on. The water area should have a fine gravel bottom with a filter in the corner and a heater just below it. The water level should just cover the land area and should not be deeper than half a centimetre at the highest point. Add any decorations that you want and setup your tank however you like this is just my setup.
                     A lid is necessary because mudskippers will skip away whenever they can.
